# Siamese-Networks-For-Dementia-Detection-from-Speech
The purpose of this study is to identify dementia using major solitary speech traits. This study's main contribution is the discovery of a small group of speech variables that facilitate dementia detection. Utilizing deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models for the recognition challenge is the secondary contribution.
